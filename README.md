# Drug Shortage Prediction and Supply Chain Optimisation using Machine Learning

This project uses a machine learning pipeline to predict drug shortages and improve healthcare supply chain efficiency. A novel **Therapeutic Risk Score** is introduced to enhance the sensitivity and prioritization of critical medications.

## ðŸš€ Overview

The goal of this project is to help healthcare providers proactively manage drug shortages by using historical data and machine learning models. It combines shortage reports and drug utilization data to predict high-risk shortages in advance.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- ML pipeline for drug shortage prediction
- Integration of a novel **Therapeutic Risk Score**
- Models used: Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Separate performance analysis for training and test data
- Visualizations of model results

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- **Data Sources:** Drug Shortages Canada portal, Medicaid drug data

## ðŸ“Š Results

- Achieved high accuracy in predicting compromised drugs
- Visualized evaluation metrics in both tabular and graphical forms
- Risk scoring improved clinical relevance and decision-making
